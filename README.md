# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a simple command-line calculator that computes **simple interest** using a Bash script.

## Description

The Simple Interest Calculator calculates interest based on the standard formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate of Interest × Time) / 100

The calculator takes user input for:
- **Principal amount**
- **Rate of interest (in percentage)**
- **Time period (in years)**

## How It Works

The script prompts the user to enter the required values and then displays:
- The calculated **simple interest**
- The **total amount** (principal + interest)

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x simple-interest.sh
2.Run the script:
./simple-interest.sh
3.Enter the principal, rate of interest, and time period when prompted.
example:
Enter the Principal amount: 1000
Enter the Rate of Interest (in %): 5
Enter the Time period (in years): 2

Simple Interest: 100.00
Total Amount: 1100.00
Requirements
